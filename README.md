# FilmLocationsRestService

Author: Salih Gecal

This web service accesses an API from https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am and returns title and locations of a film shot in San Francisco.
There are two options:
.../FilmLocations/rest/           Returns all titles and locations
.../FilmLocations/rest/"title"    Returns all titles matching the title

To access the functionality, deploy it on a server (e.g. Tomcat) and run the server.
